## Hi there 👋
Connect with me at @harithac.contactmail@gmail.com to discuss an opportunity! 🚀


## ✨ Thank you for stopping by! ✨  
Nice to meet you!
I am an Innovator with 8+ years of engineering and consulting expertise. Currently contributing expertise to organizations while we identify ML opportunities to go-to-market solutions.

**At work, 🔭  I am spearheading the development of ML and data workflows in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), enhancing performance and scalability, by leveraging Vertex AI to orchestrate end-to-end ML pipelines and robust MLOps practices to ensure seamless deployment. I Craft and manage sophisticated CI/CD pipelines on GitHub, automating the lifecycle of machine learning applications from development to deployment.**


## More about me!
- ⚡ I am keen about: Building LLM based solutions, share & discuss GenAI developments with community!
