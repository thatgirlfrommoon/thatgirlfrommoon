## Hi there 👋
Connect with me at @harithac.contactmail@gmail.com to discuss an opportunity! 🚀


✨ Thank you for stopping by! ✨  
I am an Innovator with 8+ years of engineering and consulting expertise, with a strong academic foundation in Machine learning ( M.Tech ). Currently contributing expertise to organizations while we identify Advanced Analytics and ML opportunities and deliver data-driven, decision-making, go-to-market solutions to existing operational framework dilemmas.

- 🔭 At work, I am spearheading the development of ML and data workflows in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), enhancing performance and scalability, by leveraging Vertex AI to orchestrate end-to-end ML pipelines and robust MLOps practices to ensure seamless deployment. I Craft and manage sophisticated CI/CD pipelines on GitHub, automating the lifecycle of machine learning applications from development to deployment.

- ⚡ I am keen about: Building solution on LLM models to learn discuss more about GenAI developments!
